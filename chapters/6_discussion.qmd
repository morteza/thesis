# General Discussion

#### On the importance of cognitive control research {.unnumbered}
Psychology is tasked to make sense of what humans do, and what humans do depends on what happens in their immediate environment [@miller1960]. One ability that is of utmost importance to human functioning is to exercise cognitive control which enables pursuing goals in a changing world, avoiding prepotent responses, and effectively generalizing prior experiences to new situations. Because of its ubiquity in cognition, cognitive control plays a crucial role in our daily lives, long-term achievements, and health. Accordingly, the possibility to enhance cognitive control in a way that transfers to real life situations could have important implications.

Progress towards developing effective cognitive control training programs is however limited by  the lack of a formal, quantitative definition of cognitive control. The main challenges that this thesis aims to address are (a) to gain greater clarity on the cognitive control constructs (what it is and how to measure it), and (b) to understand what features of the cognitive system (i.e., the agent) and what features of the task (i.e., the environment) determine cognitive control, its functioning, and generalization.

#### On the importance of a multidisciplinary view of cognitive control {.unnumbered}
To address these challenges, this thesis relies on the multidisciplinary synergy within cognitive sciences, primarily between artificial intelligence, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. This synergy is apparent at several levels. First, we apply artificial intelligence techniques as mere tools in our toolbox to interpret human data. In this sense, modern machine learning models provide new insights on human cognition as they are applied to behavioral data,  scientific documents, and neuroimaging data. Second, a deeper form of interdisciplinary synergy allows us to to build bridges between disciplines to both develop new computational models that instantiate cognitive control that generalizes across tasks and to further our understanding of cognitive control in humans.

## Defining cognitive control
#### On the importance to define and quantifiy cognitive control {.unnumbered}
Concepts that capture higher-order cognitive abilities such as cognitive control are difficult to define—and consequently also to quantify. Previous research has devised a variety of theoretical constructs and cognitive tasks, the relationships between which are not always very clear. Chapter 1 (CogText) is an attempt to quantitatively assess this lack of a cohesive understanding using recent advances in artificial intelligence. More specifically, we performed a large-scale text analysis to create a knowledge graph that relates theoretical constructs and empirical tasks about cognitive control. The rationale of this analysis is that constructs are related to the extent they are assessed using a similar set of cognitive tasks and cognitive tasks are related to the extent they are thought to involve a similar set of cognitive constructs. As expected, the graph confirms the complex nature of cognitive control and illustrates two specific phenomena that may explain the difficulty of defining cognitive control: task impurity (tasks measuring multiple constructs) and construct hypernomy (multiple ways of defining and measuring constructs). These results have several implications for the study of cognitive control. First, greater theoretical clarity is needed on cognitive control—this may perhaps be achieved by adopting a more formal approach grounded in computational modeling. Second, there is currently no single task able to assess cognitive control. This implies that as a field we need to devise better environments to assess cognitive control. This could entail, for instance, assessing cognitive skills using a battery of tasks (varying contexts and demands) or to develop better, perhaps more complex tasks  (e.g., video games). Finally, because cognitive control is not associated with a single cognitive function but instead involves interactions with many cognitive processes in a multitude of different tasks, it seems likely that cognitive control is associated with a range of large-scale brain networks as opposed to a single brain area or a single brain network.

#### On the importance of an interoperable battery of tasks for humans and artificial agents (CogEnv)  {.unnumbered}
There have been important advances in both artificial intelligence and psychology that have not been integrated yet, perhaps because their relevance has not yet been fully appreciated. One impediment to such an integration and the building of a shared understanding is the lack of tools that support the direct comparison of the behavior of humans and artificial agents. There are of course many instances in the scientific literature of cases where human behavior is directly compared to the behavior of specific artificial agents. However, this type of comparison is typically done at the single task level, using a limited set of computational agents and developed in a way that doesn’t allow reuse or extensions. 

To study cognitive control, and more generally cognition, it is necessary to be able to systematically  compare human and artificial agents across multiple tasks. A tool that would allow humans and artificial agents to perform the same set of tasks and to compare their behavior directly would benefit our understanding of cognitive control in both psychology and computer science. 

To support the testing and integration of multidisciplinary theories in an interoperable environment, Chapter 2 provides a virtual environment, CogEnv, that lets us interface both humans and artificial agents to perform the exact same battery of cognitive tasks. The exact same nature and shape for the data collected from human and artificial machines facilitates their direct comparison in typical psychological experiments. As a proof of concept, we successfully trained baseline RL agents to perform a battery of cognitive control tasks for which we also collected human data. The overall framework is operational and appears very promising. A preliminary investigation illustrates the idea that the comparison of performance/error profiles of human versus baseline RL agents may reveal  aspects of human cognitive control that are yet to be addressed by artificial agents.

#### On the importance of artificial models that act and functionally decouple control from the controlled act (CogPonder)  {.unnumbered}
The goal of CogEnv is to allow for the direct comparison of computational agents and humans performing exactly the same cognitive tasks and thus to promote more systematic progress in our understanding of  cognitive control. Yet, to make progress it is necessary to develop artificial agents that are capable of performing multiple tasks and which provide insights on cognitive control. To this end, in Chapter 3, we developed CogPonder, a computational framework for general cognitive control. . It is a flexible, differentiable end-to-end deep learning model that decouples the act of control from the controlled act and that can learn to perform the same cognitive tests that are used in cognitive psychology to test humans. 

We implemented an instance of CogPonder and trained it to perform two cognitive tasks while  aligning its behavior with that of humans, collected in a previous study. The results show that after training, and across two different cognitive tasks, CogPonder behaves comparably to humans, both in terms of accuracy and response times distributions. 
These results demonstrate the value of this framework to provide interesting new insights and research opportunities for both psychological and computer science.

## Training and generalizing cognitive control

#### On the importance of cognitive training studies to study and test cognitive control  {.unnumbered}

Research in cognitive training using complex tasks such as video games may benefit from and contribute to the proposed broad view of cognitive control. Chapter 4 reviews the literature on the effects of different genres of video games on cognition. In this context, action video games—as defined by first and third person shooter games—are particularly interesting as they have specifically been associated with greater cognitive enhancement (in contrast to other forms of video games, such as puzzle or life-simulation games). These transfer effects of action video game playing to a broad range of cognitive tasks have been associated with improvements in reward processing, spatial navigation, but most importantly for us, in top-down attention and cognitive control. 
 This review highlights that cognitive training interventions need to be endowed with specific game mechanics for them to generate cognitive benefits, presumably by enhancing cognitive control abilities. We discuss what those game mechanics might be and call for a more systematic assessment of the relationship between video game mechanics and cognition. We also note that as video games become more and more advanced (i.e., mixing genres and game-play styles within the same video game), it will become increasingly difficult to study and understand their effects on cognition.  This article lays a foundation for the study of cognitive and brain functioning using video games and illustrates the value of this approach to investigate general cognitive control.

#### On the importance of studying brain function to understand cognitive control (ACNets)  {.unnumbered}
The study of the differences in functional brain networks between habitual action video game players and non-video game players can advance our understanding of both the mechanisms underlying the training effects and the neural mechanisms supporting cognitive control in general.  In Chapter 5, we show that it is possible to reliably classify new participants as either habitual action video gamers or non-video game players based on their resting-state functional connectivity. Moreover, an analysis of which features are most important for this classification accuracy reveals that what differentiates most habitual video gamers from non-video gamers is not the connectivity within specialized functional brain networks (e.g., the dorsal fronto-parietal top-down attentional network) but rather the relationships between networks, supporting current theories of action video game training that assign their benefits to domain-general abilities. Furthermore, the results show that the most important inter-network relationships in this context involve control-related and sensorimotor network (more specifically the relationships between the cingulo-opercular and the sensorimotor networks, and between fronto-parietal and the sensorimotor networks). 


 Because these results show that action video game play may affect cognitive control, they have  important implications for the study of cognitive training. Furthermore, by showing that resting-state data contains information that relates to action video gaming, these results suggest that resting-state data could be an invaluable tool to study cognitive training effects and their potential for transfer and may thus contribute to the development of more effective cognitive training programs.
Finally, these results also have practical value for cognitive scientists interested in cognitive control as they show that action video game training may be a new tool to causally study cognitive control. 


 
## Future perspectives
There are several limitations to the development of the approach outlined in this thesis. One major limitation is the scope of the environment. The present form of CogEnv for instance ignores the real-time property of most cognitive environments by providing a turn-based mechanism that suspends the environment until the agent concludes its computations and generates an action; a situation such as this is unlikely to occur in real life. One potential direction involves extending the capabilities of the CogEnv environment by establishing a larger library of computational models that can interface with it [e.g., CogPonder or more broadly real-time reinforcement learning; @ramstedt2019], and creating a more comprehensive set of cognitive tests [e.g., tests that are explored in @CogText or @Enkavi2019]. Additionally, there is potential for further refinement of the data processing and analysis pipelines, as well as the adoption of more standardized data formats that supports multiple tasks and experimental designs [see for example Behaverse data model in @AppendixB].

Another area of focus for future research could be the development of more realistic and ecologically valid cognitive tasks and experiments (cf. Discussion in @CogPonder and @ACNets). This could involve the use of video games or other rich and challenging environments, as well as the use of more complex and dynamic scenarios. By testing cognitive models in more realistic environments, we may better understand the limitations and capabilities of these models, and improve their performance.

The development of general computational cognitive control models is another important direction for future research. There are several ways to approach this research, including incorporating new computational techniques and exploring new theories.
One particularly interesting approach involves the integration of artificial intelligence techniques into cognitive modeling. This could involve applying scalable machine learning (e.g., deep learning) to complex cognitive models, in order to create more accurate and comprehensive simulations of the human brain and mind. By testing sophisticated cognitive models at scale, we can better understand the limitations and capabilities of these models, and improve their ability to explain human phenomena.
Another useful approach consists of developing  better taxonomies, concepts, and tasks—ideally via collaborative efforts of researchers in neuroscience, experimental psychology, and artificial intelligence—which may lead to more comprehensive and consistent models of cognitive functions. For example, psychologists can provide detailed ontologies of cognitive processes, while neuroscientists provide insights into the underlying brain mechanisms that support those processes, and computer scientists develop new algorithms and technologies for modeling and testing those processes.

A multidisciplinary synergy may also be achieved through direct comparisons of human and artificial agents. By using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, it is possible to create artificial agents that mimic human cognitive processes. By comparing the performance of these agents to human subjects on a variety of cognitive environments, we can better understand the similarities and differences between human and artificial cognition, and develop more accurate and comprehensive models of the human mind.

The use of previously unexplored experimental techniques is another important direction for future research in cognitive control. In particular, the combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI, along with the use of multitask batteries and interventional experimental designs can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cognitive control. Integrating task-driven and resting-state fMRI data has the potential to inform us about the neural basis of cognitive control (see Appendix XX for a study protocol that goes along these lines). This information can be used to develop scientific theories of cognitive control, and to identify potential neural markers of cognitive control abilities. By including multitask batteries to assess transfer effects, it is possible to determine how the brain enables generalizing prior performance on one task to another. This information can help to understand the underlying mechanisms of cognitive control, and to develop theories about how cognitive control abilities are acquired and generalized, and why some interventions are successful while others are not.

## Conclusion
Taken together, the current work explores approaches from a variety of cognitive science disciplines that together aim to better delineate the fuzzy concept of cognitive control. I presented cases in which neuroscience, experimental psychology, and artificial intelligence can join forces in advancing our understanding of cognitive control and the challenge of generalizing this capacity to new contexts (i.e., transfer effect). In the age of ubiquitous computing and large datasets, building bridges between behavior, brain and computation has the potential to deeply transform our understanding of the human mind and inspire the development of truly intelligent artificial agents.
