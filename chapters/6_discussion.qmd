# General Discussion

<the importance of cognitive control research>
Modern psychology is tasked to find systems to make sense of what humans do, and what humans do depends on what happens around them in the environment [@miller1960]. One ability that is of utmost importance to human functioning is to exercise cognitive control which enables pursuing goals in the world around us, avoiding prepotent responses, and effectively generalizing prior experiences to new situations. Due to the presence of cognitive control in many aspects of what we do, cognitive control plays a crucial role in our daily lives, long-term achievements, and psychological health. Accordingly, the possibility to enhance cognitive control in a way that transfers to real life situations could have important implications across a wide range of applications.

Yet, the lack of a formal, quantitative definition of cognitive control hinders research from moving forward. Mainly, this thesis highlights two challenges about cognitive control: (a) gaining greater clarity on the cognitive control constructs (what it is and how to measure it), and (b) to understand what features of the cognitive system (i.e., the agent) and what features of the task (i.e., the environment) determine cognitive control, its functioning, and generalization.

<the importance of multidisciplinary view>
To address those challenges, this thesis relies on the multidisciplinary synergy cognitive fields, primarily between artificial intelligence, psychology, and neuroscience. The importance of the synergy is twofold. First is applying artificial intelligence techniques as mere tools in our toolbox to interpret human data. In this sense, computational models help to analyze present data about human cognition including scientific texts, behavioral data, and neuroimaging data. Second, a more interdisciplinary synergy however would leverage recent artificial models to inform us how cognitive control is realized and generalized across tasks and how the human brain enables cognitive control and its generalization.


## Defining cognitive control
<CC is hard to define and quantify (CogText)>
Concepts that capture higher-order cognitive abilities such as cognitive control are difficult to define—and consequently also to quantify. Nevertheless, to understand cognitive control, previous research has devised a variety of theoretical constructs and cognitive tasks; the relationships between which are not always very clear. Chapter 2 addresses this lack of a cohesive understanding about what researchers mean by cognitive control and how to quantify it. Here, recent advances in artificial intelligence help to make conceptual and empirical clarifications about cognitive control.

We performed a large-scale text analysis to create a knowledge graph that relates theoretical constructs and empirical tasks about cognitive control. As expected, the graph confirms the complex nature of cognitive control. It further shows two specific phenomena that explain the difficulty of defining cognitive control: task impurity (tasks measuring multiple constructs) and construct hypernomy (different ways of defining constructs and thus measuring them by different tasks). Results implies that cognitive control can’t be assessed using a single task and should instead be measured using a battery of tasks (varying contexts and demands) or more complex tasks (e.g., video games). And second, results suggest that cognitive control is not exclusively associated with a single cognitive function hence underlying brain region or network, but it emerges as the interaction between a range of cognitive functions that are associated with a range of large-scale brain networks.

<the importance of an interoperable battery of tasks for humans and artificial agents (CogEnv)>
There have been important advances in artificial intelligence and psychology that haven't been perceived as relevant. One impediment to a shared understanding is the lack of tools that can integrate human data and artificial agents. A key step towards making this happen is to make it possible, and even easy, to compare human and artificial agents directly. There are many cases where this has been successfully done at the single task level. But there is comparatively less work comparing human and artificial agents across multiple tasks.

The broader view of cognitive control, as it has several times in the past, leads to insights that benefit new developments in artificial intelligence. For artificial agents that exhibit cognitive control need to be able to function, first, in environments that require multiple dimensions of cognitive control (i.e., a battery of tasks). And second, in the same way as in human studies (i.e., constrained by cognitive capacities). From the computational perspective, this signifies the need for an artificial environment with multiple cognitive tasks, and an agent architecture that is able to capture the varying aspects of humans performing cognitive tasks.

To support the testing and integration of multidisciplinary theories in an interoperable environment, Chapter 2 provides a virtual environment, CogEnv, that lets us interface both humans and artificial agents to perform the exact same battery of cognitive control tasks. The exact same nature and shape for the data collected from human and artificial machines would facilitate the direct comparison of them in typical psychological experiments. As a proof of concept, we successfully trained baseline RL agents to perform a battery of cognitive control tasks of which we also collected human data. The overall framework is operational and appears very promising. A preliminary investigation illustrates the idea that the comparison of performance/error profiles of human versus baseline RL agents may reveal  aspects of human cognitive control that are yet to be addressed by artificial agents.

<the importance of artificial models that act and functionally decouple control from the controlled act (CogPonder)>
The goal of developing CogEnv was to clarify cognitive control using computational agents that do exactly the same thing as humans do in cognitive tests. We would still require both agents, biological or artificial, to share functional accounts of cognitive control. To this end, in Chapter 3, we developed a generic, but shared, representation of response times for human and artificial agents using a computational model that decouples the act of control from the controlled act. We implemented a flexible, differentiable end-to-end deep learning model that can perform the same cognitive tests that are used in cognitive psychology to test humans. The model can be trained to generate behavior (i.e., accuracy and response times distributions) that is similar to human behavior across multiple experimental conditions, thus providing a means for further investigating both human cognition and the computational model.

The proposed model is very flexible (i.e., CogPonder can wrap around any end-to-end deep learning model so is unattached to specific model choices) and can be extended in many ways (e.g., using more advanced computational techniques to perform complex tasks). Most importantly, the proposed framework explicitly connects behavioral data to artificial agents that produce human-like behaviors on a battery of cognitive control tasks. The framework thus provides interesting new insights and research opportunities for both psychological and computer science.

## Training and generalizing cognitive control

<Not all generalization would work, AVGP transfers better to novel situations (Review)>
Research in cognitive training using complex tasks such as video games may reap the benefits from the proposed broad view of cognitive control. Chapter 4 highlights that different genres of video games have different effects on cognition. Action video games—as defined by first and third person shooter games—have been associated with greater cognitive enhancement, especially when it comes to cognitive control and top-down attention, than puzzle or life-simulation games. Playing action video games seems also to impact reward processing, spatial navigation, and reconfiguration of attentional control networks in the brain.

Interpretations of the effects of playing action video games on behavior and the brain have been attributed to various psychological constructs, in particular attentional control, quick processing of sensory information, and rapid responses. These results suggest that cognitive training interventions need to be endowed with specific game mechanics for them to generate cognitive benefits, presumably by enhancing cognitive control abilities. We discuss what those game mechanics might be and call for a more systematic assessment of the relationship between video game mechanics and cognition. We also note that as video games become more and more advanced (i.e., mixing genres and game-play styles within the same video game), it will become increasingly difficult to study and understand their effects on cognition.  This article lays a foundation for the study of cognitive and brain functioning using video games and illustrates the value of this approach to investigate general cognitive control.

<Cognitive control emerges from a distributed set of brain networks each featuring different cognitive functions (ACNets)>
The study of the differences in functional brain networks between habitual action video game players and non-video game players can advance our understanding of both the mechanisms underlying the training effects and the neural mechanisms supporting cognitive control in general.  We show that resting-state functional connectivity is a reliable predictor of habitual action video gamers. Moreover, a successful prediction relies on connectivities between control-related networks and sensorimotor, and those connectivities are more diagnostic than activities that are restricted to one brain network. While many functional connectivities contributed to the prediction accuracy, feature importance analysis revealed that the interplay between cognitive control networks (cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor networks, and then between fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks) had the highest impact on the prediction accuracy. Confirming that action video game play affects cognitive control (via its functional neural underpinnings) has important implications for the study of cognitive training. It also has practical value as it would offer cognitive neuroscientists a new tool to causally study cognitive control. Finally, this type of work could lay a foundation towards bridging a gap between experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive sciences; brain function may for instance inspire new computational theories and behavioral experiments.

Further study of cognitive control training and its determinants is essential from a theoretical perspective. This research can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying cognitive control, as well as potential ways to achieve board generalization through training. Additionally, a better understanding of the determinants of cognitive control training can help identify individual differences that may predict success or failure in such interventions. This knowledge can inform the development of more effective training programs and ultimately improve our understanding of the complex processes involved in cognitive control.

Furthermore, the study of cognitive training offers a unique opportunity to causally test computational theories of human-like control and precise evaluation of theoretical models. This helps bridge the gap between computational models and real-world behavior, providing a more comprehensive understanding of human cognitive control.
 
## Future perspectives
There are several limitations to the development of the approach outlined in this thesis. One major limitation is the scope of the environment. The present form of CogEnv for instance ignores the real-time property of most cognitive environments by providing a turn-based mechanism that suspends the environment until the agent concludes its computations and generates an action; a situation such as this is unlikely to occur in real life. One potential direction involves extending the capabilities of the CogEnv environment by establishing a larger library of computational models that can interface with it [e.g., CogPonder or more broadly real-time reinforcement learning; @ramstedt2019], and creating a more comprehensive set of cognitive tests [e.g., tests that are explored in @CogText or @Enkavi2019]. Additionally, there is potential for further refinement of the data processing and analysis pipelines, as well as the adoption of more standardized data formats that supports multiple tasks and experimental designs [see for example Behaverse data model in @AppendixB].

Another area of focus for future research could be the development of more realistic and ecologically valid cognitive tasks and experiments (cf. Discussion in @CogPonder and @ACNets). This could involve the use of video games or other rich and challenging environments, as well as the use of more complex and dynamic scenarios. By testing cognitive models in more realistic environments, we can better understand the limitations and capabilities of these models, and improve their performance.

The development of general computational cognition control models is another important direction for future research. There are several ways to approach this research, including incorporating new computational techniques and exploring new theories.
One potential approach is the integration of artificial intelligence techniques into cognitive modeling. This could involve applying scalable machine learning (e.g., deep learning) to complex cognitive models, in order to create more accurate and comprehensive simulations of the human brain and mind. By testing sophisticated cognitive models at scale, we can better understand the limitations and capabilities of these models, and improve their ability to explain human phenomena.
Another potential approach is the development of better taxonomies, concepts, and tasks through the collaboration of researchers in neuroscience, experimental psychology, and artificial intelligence. It may then be possible to develop more comprehensive models of cognitive functions. For example, psychologists can provide detailed ontologies of cognitive processes, while neuroscientists provide insights into the underlying brain mechanisms that support those processes, and computer scientists develop new algorithms and technologies for modeling and testing the processes.

Alternatively, a multidisciplinary synergy can also be achieved through direct comparisons of human and artificial agents. By using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, it is possible to create artificial agents that can simulate human cognitive processes by a similar set of intertwined, but functionally separate, processes to cognitive functions. By comparing the performance of these agents to human subjects on a variety of cognitive environments, we can better understand the similarities and differences between human and artificial cognition, and develop more accurate and comprehensive models of the human mind.

The use of previously unexplored experimental techniques is another important direction for future research in cognitive control. In particular, the combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI, along with the use of multitask batteries and interventional experimental designs can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cognitive control. Integrating task-driven and resting-state fMRI data has the potential to inform us about the neural basis of cognitive control. This information can be used to develop scientific theories of cognitive control, and to identify potential neural markers of cognitive control abilities. By including multitask batteries to assess transfer effects, it is possible to determine how the brain enables generalizing prior performance on one task to another. This information can help to understand the underlying mechanisms of cognitive control, and to develop theories about how cognitive control abilities are acquired and generalized; and why some interventions are successful while others are not.

## Conclusion

Taken together, the current work explores approaches from a variety of cognitive science disciplines that together aim to better delineate the fuzzy concept of cognitive control. I presented cases in which neuroscience, experimental psychology, and artificial intelligence can join forces in advancing our understanding about cognitive control and the challenge of generalizing this capacity to new contexts (i.e., transfer effect). In the age of computational models, the parallel between behavioral data, neuroimaging data, and artificial agents has the potential to become an important research program in multidisciplinary sciences.
