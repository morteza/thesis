# Towards a Computational Model of General <mark>Cognitive Control</mark> Using Artificial Intelligence, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience

<!--
::: {.notes}

My thesis aims to further our understanding of higher-order cognition. More specifically, I'm interested in our ability to be goal-driven and which enables us to produce complex, meaningful, context-dependent behavior, in uncertain environments, inhibit prepotent responses, monitor and manage the cross-talk between conflicting tasks.
