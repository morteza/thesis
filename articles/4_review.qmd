# Training Cognition with Video Games


## Abstract {.unnumbered}
 
This chapter reviews the behavioral and neuroimaging scientific literature on the cognitive consequences of playing various genres of video games.  The available research highlights that not all video games have similar cognitive impact; action video games as defined by first and third person shooter games have been associated with greater cognitive enhancement, especially when it comes to top-down attention, than puzzle or life-simulation games.  
 
This state of affair suggests specific game mechanics need to be embodied in a video game for it to enhance cognition. These hypothesized game mechanics are reviewed; yet, we note that the advent of more complex, hybrid video games poses new research challenges and call for a more systematic assessment of how specific video game mechanics relate to cognitive enhancement.

 
## Introduction
Across all ages, cognitive abilities play an important role in our quality of life and the type of life we lead. At young ages, executive functions, a cornerstone of cognitive abilities, are thought to determine educational achievement [e.g., @diamond2013; @bull2008; @geary2019; @goldin2014] and more generally to be “critical for success in school and life” [@diamond2007]. Longitudinal studies in young children, for example report that cognitive abilities predict educational achievement attained two years later [@bull2008; @gathercole2004]. Among executive functions, attentional control abilities have been of special interest as they mediate a various array of skills, from sustained attention in school to divided attention in team sports. In older adults, for example, attentional abilities correlate with driving accidents—the shrinkage in a persons’ useful field of view, which is the spatial extent of their visual field to which they effectively pay attention, is strongly associated with a higher incidence of car accidents prior to the attentional test [@ball1993]. The central role cognitive abilities play in our lives has led to many attempts to devise behavioral training programs to improve cognition, and in particular executive functions [@katz2018]. While cognitive enhancement raises ethical concerns (similar to doping in sports), it also holds the promise for broad societal benefits [@bavelier2019].
 
Numerous forms of cognitive training exist; yet, their efficiency and the underlying causal mechanisms remain controversial. This is the case, for example, of interventions attempting to improve fluid intelligence by training executive functions [e.g., @jaeggi2008; @au2015; @melby-lervag2013]. A key concern in the cognitive training literature is that training of specialized cognitive functions may lead to improvements in only those trained functions (i.e., “near transfer”) and may not transfer to a broader range of tasks and situations (i.e., “far transfer”). While the necessary conditions for far transfer remain to be firmly established, variety in the training regime and the trained functions appear to be key factors [for an example in the domain of sports, see @gullich2018]. An alternative perspective on the plasticity of cognitive abilities is to focus, not on targeted interventions designed by researchers, but rather to consider the impact of changes in our environment. The Flynn effect, or the rise of IQ scores through the 20th century, is one such example. With the advent of digital media, our lifestyle and cognitive activities—starting at the youngest ages—have radically changed over the past decades. For example, it has been argued that the excessive consumption of multiple media at the same time (e.g., texting while watching TV and browsing the web) may cause an attentional impairment in filtering out distraction [@ophir2009]; although more recent data are less clear cut [for reviews, see @wiradhany2017; @uncapher2018]. Whether those media-based environmental changes are for the better or for the worse remains highly debated [e.g., @ophir2009; @bavelier2010; @sparrow2011]. Yet, investigating those effects holds the promise of bringing new insights into human brain plasticity and cognitive training.
 
 
Digital media occupy an increasingly large portion of our waking time. In the US, 8-12 year olds spend close to 6 hours on media each day [@rideout2016]—with similar trends being reported all over the world [e.g., @bodson2017; @waller2016]. Digital media affect every aspect of our lives; these effects are complex and not fully understood yet [@bavelier2010]. They depend not only on the specific medium being used but also how they are consumed and what content they deliver [e.g., @cardoso-leite2016]. Here we limit our scope by focusing on the effects of playing video games on cognition. This choice is motivated by three main points: (i) while the field of media and cognition is quite young, it is already clear that not all media use have the same impact on cognition implying that different media uses need to be considered separately (as stated earlier, media multitasking may be related to attentional deficits, while playing specific video games have instead be linked to attentional improvements); (ii) video games stand on their own by immersing players in extremely rich and complex experiences with high cognitive demands (a person watching television may spend hours without performing any significant action, while people playing video games may perform multiple meaningful decisions and actions per second); (iii) and finally, the literature concerning the impact of video game play on behavior, including cognition, is arguably one of the best documented today. We will focus only on the relationship between video game play and cognition and will not consider other aspects that might be equally important but are outside the scope of this work, such as the impact of violence, self-image, well-being, creativity, social functioning, or addiction [for reviews on such topics see, @gentile2017; @kiraly2017; @stanhope2015].
 
 
Almost everyone plays video games now. Although the term video game raises the stereotypical image of the adolescent glued to his screen, there are now as many females, 50 or older, playing video games as there are boys under 18 playing video games. Interestingly, these two groups do not engage with the same genres of video games; older females mostly play puzzle or casual games, while boys play predominantly action-packed, role-playing games. This state of affairs highlights the need to pay close attention to video game genre or the type of experience different video games deliver. In 2015, both “tweens” (8-12 years old) and teens (13-18 year olds) in the US devoted on average about 1 hour and 20 minutes to playing video games each day; with boys playing substantially more than girls [@rideout2015]. The relationship between video game play and cognition has been investigated in various large-scale correlation studies that collect data about children's gaming habits and various measures of interest [@adachi2013; @kovess-masfety2016; @stanhope2015]. One such study, conducted in Europe, reported that video game play was associated with enhanced intellectual, social and academic functioning [as rated by the child’s teacher; @kovess-masfety2016]. Another associated gaming in 7-11 years old with faster response speeds, enhanced sustained attention and academic performance; but only for intermediate amounts of video game play per day [@pujol2016]. A recent study on 3 to 7-year-old children furthermore documents that casual video game play at this young age may increase fluid intelligence [@fikkers2019]. It thus appears that, at a macro-level, playing video games *in general* might have beneficial effects on cognition and educational achievement. However, in these studies, researchers typically don’t evaluate the effects associated with *specific* genres of video games. Thus, the above macro-level effects actually represent an average over numerous micro-level effects induced for example by playing different genres of video games. Some of these micro-level effects may be negative and others positive.
 
 
The purpose of this chapter is to review the scientific evidence regarding the relationship between playing commercially available video games, as assessed behaviorally or through brain imaging and their potential impact on human cognitive abilities. While many unknowns remain on this topic, it appears clear today that among the many factors to consider is the specific genre of video game being played [e.g., @sala2018; @bediou2018; @powers2014; @powers2013; @toril2014; @wang2016]. Following this work, we review below our current understanding of the impact of video games first in general and then narrowing in on the specific game genre that appears most effective to improve cognition.
 
 
 
## Which Video Games Improve Cognition?
 
Video games come in many different flavors; classifying video games in genres has proven elusive and there is no consensual taxonomy to date. Fifteen years ago when the research on the cognitive effects of video games gained significant traction, researchers seemed to commonly classify video games in a small set of video game genres (see Table 1). Since then, video games, video gamers and gaming has changed considerably and it seems that the video game classifications that have been used in this field are not adequate to characterize contemporary gaming [@dale2020; @dale2017a]. This being said, because the current review focuses on past research that tended to use older games, and to keep in line with the cited literature, we will use the game genres as described in Table 1. Note that in this literature “action video games” has been used to refer to first and third person shooters, although some authors have made it more inclusive. In this review, “action video games” will strictly refer to first and third person shooters. 
 
 
A wide range of commercial video games have been used in psychological research to evaluate their relationship to or impact on cognition [@bediou2018; @sala2018]. Video game research has proceeded using a variety of study designs, including cross-sectional and intervention studies (“true experiments”). Among the latter, we find studies looking at short-lived effects on the scale of a few minutes and intervention studies looking at more long-lasting effects, from days to months or even years (see @fig-expdesign) for the design of such intervention studies). True experiments are necessary to rule out the possibility that the observed group differences pre-date the video gaming activities, and thus assess the causal role of video game play.

Intervention design to evaluate the causal impact of playing a specific type of video games on cognition (here termed experimental game). Participants are randomly assigned to play experimental video games or control video games. The training program typically requires at least 8 hours, and typically tens of hours of gameplay, distributed over weeks or months. Participants’ cognitive skills are first evaluated on a battery of tests (pre-test) and tested again after completion of their training (post-test). If playing the experimental video games specifically improves the cognitive abilities assessed, then we expect the experimental group to improve more from pre- to post-test than the control group.

An important point to keep in mind in this literature is that all video games are not created equal as to their impact on cognition. Specific genres of video games have been shown to be effective in improving some aspects of cognition while others haven’t. Studies that lump together all types of video game play are therefore at risk of blurring existing effects; for this reason, a number of studies adopt a more principled approach and focus on specific genres of video games.
A recent meta-analysis evaluated the impact of playing video games on cognition using a rather broad view of what counts as a video game [@sala2018]. \@fig-expsala and @fig-ctrlsala use data from that meta-analysis and list the video games (or other activities) and their frequency of use in intervention studies aiming to enhance cognitive abilities. @fig-expsala lists the games that were used for the experimental group, while Figure @fig-ctrlsala, lists games and activities that were used in active control groups. Several points are worth noting here. First, experimental and control activities vary widely. This variety makes it difficult to regroup these studies under one common research question as they each test different hypotheses. For example, when contrasting playing *Unreal Tournament* (FPS) vs. *Tetris* (Puzzle), one asks about the cognitive impact of action, first-person shooter games as compared to other games that also load highly on speed of processing and motor control; yet when contrasting playing *Tetris* (Puzzle)  vs. *The Sims* (Life-Simulation Game), one rather asks about the possibility of training mental rotation by contrasting a game that requires such process and one that does not. Second, many of the activities listed are in fact not video games (e.g., paper-and-pencil games, watching videos). When contrasting, for example, playing a specific video game to playing paper-and-pencil games it is unclear if such studies evaluate the effectiveness of a specific video game, the impact of using a console, looking at a screen, or of digital media in general. Given the complexity of interpreting the outcome of grouping together and contrasting such a wide variety of activities, other meta-analyses investigating the impact of video game play on cognition have been more focused. The rationale here has been to group together video game genres that share features hypothesized to enhance cognition and to include only studies using other commercial video games as active control.
Twenty years ago, researchers noticed by chance that study participants playing regularly first and third person shooters exhibited outstanding performance in attentional tasks [@bavelier2016] and subsequently conducted an experimental study to test and verify the causal impact of playing those types of video games on attention [in contrast to a control group that played a different type of games; @green2003]. These results led  most of the field to focused on the impact of first and third person shooter games (e.g., *Unreal Tournament; Medal of Honor* (FPS)), also known as action video games, on cognition. Not surprisingly this is the most represented video game genre in the available literature. This is followed by racing games (e.g., *Mario Kart*, *Crazy Taxi*, *Need for Speed*) with rarer reports on real time strategy games (e.g., *StarCraft*, *Rise of Nations*, see @fig-expsala). While we will discuss below why these video game genres may be specifically well-tuned to change aspects of cognition, we now turn to the control games used in such studies. As illustrated by @fig-ctrlsala, the video games most commonly used as controls are social simulation games such as *The Sims* (a life simulator game) and puzzle  or visuo-motor coordination games (e.g., *Tetris*, *Ballance*, *Angry Birds*). This raises the possibility these genres have the least impact on cognition. Yet, it should be clear that different game genres might have different cognitive effects. Thus, depending on the study, the same game may be used for the experimental or for the control group. It appears from these figures that there is minimal overlap between the two lists (@fig-expsala) vs. @fig-ctrlsala; see also @fig-expben and @fig-ctrlben)). A notable exception is *Tetris* which has been frequently used both as a control and as a cognitive training game, especially targeting mental rotation abilities. Below we review the literature for the main active game video game genres listed above.

This list contains a wide range of video game genres that have been used for training in the scientific literature (e.g., first person shooters, racing games, puzzle games, real-time strategy games, sports games) as well as non-video games (Space Fortress). Large differences in experiences between different game genres (a fast-paced multiplayer FPS is nothing like a slow paced, single player puzzle game) render the interpretation of any such results (positive, negative or null impact on cognition) quite difficult. This figure counts the number of publications cited in @sala2018 that used a particular video game (out of a total of 63 publications). Note that a publication could involve multiple experiments, each using potentially a different set of video games.

## First and Third Person Shooters (“Action” Video Games)
 
The game genre that has been most studied within the context of cognitive improvement is without a doubt First and Third Person Shooters [e.g., @bediou2018; see also the correction to this article https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148383]. This category of games has traditionally been called “Action Video Games” (AVG) in the field; however, the changing landscape of video games has made this nomenclature outdated and better classifications are needed [@dale2020; @dale2017]. First/Third Person Shooter games are (1) fast-paced, involving rapidly moving objects (e.g., projectiles) and transient events (e.g., explosion); they (2) require participants to distribute their attention to monitor events from central vision to the visual periphery; they (3) demand a high attentional focus by loading perceptual, cognitive and motor systems; and finally they contain (4) temporal and spatial uncertainty preventing full task automatization [@cardoso-leite2020]. Games in this category are typically violent and include titles like *Medal of Honor* and *Call of Duty*. It is critical to note that, contrary to what some have argued, action video games are not simply “any physically challenging video game in which reaction time plays a crucial role” [p1.; @karimpur2015]. There are many games that require fast and accurate responding (e.g., fighting games, games like the *The World’s Hardest Game*) that do not fulfill the criteria listed above.


Two types of studies investigated the relationship between action video gaming and cognition: correlation studies—where habitual first/third person shooter video game players (AVGP) are contrasted to individuals playing almost no video games at all (i.e., non video game players; NVGP)—and intervention studies—where individuals with only moderate video game play experience are asked to play either an action video game or a non-action video game for multiple hours distributed over weeks (see \@fig-expdesign). Correlational studies document significant differences between habitual AVGP and NVGP, leaving unclear the source of the difference. Intervention studies can clarify the causal role of video game play, as they evaluate whether game play changes performance between a baseline time before participants engage in the game play to a time after they have completed their game play training.
Research on action video games has matured over the past 20 years and there is now a growing body of correlational and intervention studies—almost all of which however focus on healthy young adults. These intervention studies show for example that playing action video games rather than other forms of video games, causes improvements in visual perceptual abilities [@chopin2019], spatial cognition [@spence2010],some forms of memory [@pavan2019; @sungur2012],
and perhaps even academic topics such as reading [@franceschini2015] or mathematical skills [@libertus2017]. A recent meta-analysis has evaluated the impact of action video game on cognition subdividing  outcome variables into one of 7 cognitive domains [@bediou2018]: (1) perception, (2) top-down attention, (3) spatial cognition, (4) multitasking, (5) inhibition, (6) problem solving and (7) verbal cognition. Data from correlational studies show that habitual AVGP outperform NVGP in all of these domains with statistically significant effects for all but the less studied (6) problem solving category. Data from intervention studies show a similar trend, with AVG training causing numerically improved performance in all domains as compared to training with other commercial games. These effects are however smaller in size and less reliable than those observed in correlational studies, certainly calling for caution. Of all the domains studied, we note that top-down attention and spatial cognition seem most reliably improved by action video gaming interventions. The reduced effect sizes in intervention studies compared to correlational studies may be due to action video game players in the latter having substantially more gaming experience than the tens of hours typical of training studies. The reduced reliability on the other hand is due to both the effect sizes being smaller and to the reduced number of intervention studies per domain. As more studies are conducted, it will become clearer how much each specific domains may be positively impacted by playing action video games.

Most action video game studies focus on healthy young adults. A reason for this is that action video games are not adequate for children because of their violent content and they are not adequate for older adults because of their high difficulty level. While no experimental study would expose children to violent video games, some children do in fact play those age-inappropriate, violent games in their homes. In their meta-analysis @bediou2018 list three such cross-sectional studies focusing on the relationship between action video game and children’s cognition. One such study tested typically-developing children and young adults, with ages ranging from 7 to 22 years, on three attentional tasks: the Useful Field of View (spatial attention), the Attentional Blink (temporal attention) and the Multiple Object Tracking task [sustained, dynamic attention; @dye2009]. In addition, these authors collected survey data about each participants’ video gaming habits, allowing them to form two subgroups of participants: AVGP and NVGP. This type of data can be used to describe the time course of attentional development and evaluate how these time courses differ between AVGP and NVGP. The results show that AVGP presented a time course of attentional development that was accelerated compared to that of NVGP. The extent and onset of these group differences depended on the specific aspect of attention being considered. AVGP performed better than NVGP on the temporal attention task (i.e., attentional blink) starting at age 7-10, on the spatial attention (i.e., UFOV) at ages 11-13 and on the dynamic attention task (i.e., MOT) at ages 14-17. Such results confirm that various components of attention mature at different speeds and suggest they may be differentially affected by action video game play. Overall, the cross-sectional data collected on children present a pattern of results similar to what is observed in adults and indicate that action video games training may also be effective at younger ages.
 
 
To investigate the causal role of action video games on cognition in children, while avoiding exposing them to violent content, a few studies have selected commercial, age-appropriate mini-games that contain features similar to those attributed to action video games. @franceschini2013 have used this approach in 7-13 year old dyslexic Italian children to test the hypothesis that enhancing visual attention in Italian readers may in part alleviate reading difficulties. Children trained for 12 hours over two weeks either on action-like mini-games or control mini-games from *Rayman Raving Rabbids*. Note that *Rayman Raving Rabbids* comprises a large set of varied, small party games and thus does not technically fall in the first or third person shooter category. However, the authors rated each of the party-games from that collection as being action-video-game-like or not based on game features typically assigned to action video games. Mini games classified as action-video-game like were used for the experimental group while the mini games devoid of action mechanics were used for the control group. The training was distributed over about two weeks; those children assigned to play the action like mini-games displayed improvements in attention and in reading abilities, at least as measured by timed tasks of reading, as compared to a control group that played non-action-like games for the same amount of time [@franceschini2013]. These first results were later confirmed in an English speaking sample of dyslexic children [@franceschini2017] and supported by a small sample, correlationational study on typically reading French adults [@antzaka2017]. Yet, whether action or phonologically-based video games may help remediate dyslexia certainly remains controversial as other intervention studies have failed to find a positive impact on reading acquisition [@luniewska2018]. Moreover, a recent large sample correlational study that contrasted children who report playing video games to those that do not found a negative association between video game play and reading [@seok2019]. The interpretation of this latter result remains difficult as it did not differentiate between game genres and had an overrepresentation of male children in the video game players group (indeed, if most video game players are boys, it’s unclear if the effects relate to playing video games rather than other factors associated with boys being worse readers). Exploiting the proposal that action video game enhanced top-down attention, a recent study documents enhanced ability at performing optimal cue combination in 4-5 year old children after 7.5 hours of action-video-game-like mini-games (e.g., Fruit Ninja), as compared to playing control mini games [e.g., Puzzingo; training was distributed over 2 weeks; @nava2019]. While the reviewed evidence points towards action video games having some efficacy in enhancing cognition, and especially attention in children, the empirical data is scarce and further studies are needed to confirm or infirm these results.
 
 
The use of action video gaming to train older adults’ cognition is also quite rare [for a review, see @toril2014]. One study had 65-91 year olds play either a first-person shooter (*Medal of Honor*), a puzzle game (*Tetris*) or an attention-training task (UFOV training) for six 90-minutes session or nothing (no-contact control group). Contrary to what was observed in younger adults, action video play did not improve attentional performance more than playing the puzzle game [@belchior2012]. However, as pointed out by the authors, action video games might be too hard for older adults and training duration not long enough for them to learn how to play the game before the game could train their cognitive abilities. Indeed, players in the action video game group had to receive a step-by-step, PowerPoint-based explanation of the game by an experienced coach to make the difficulty level “manageable”. Supporting this view, @boot2013 reported lower compliance in the action group than the other training groups in a sample of older adults. Because off-the-shelf action video games are designed to be challenging for adolescents and young adults already cognizant of the genre, they are likely too hard to be used with older adults [for a discussion, see section “Does Action Video Game Play Impact All Ages Equally?” in @bediou2018]. Indeed, training with video games obey the same learning rules as training with any other forms of behavioral interventions [@stafford2014]. In particular, to be efficient, the training difficulty needs to be adapted to the learner’s level, a concept pioneered as early as the 1900’s by Vygotsky and his proposed “zone of proximal development”. Thus, to train cognition in older adults it might be preferable to specifically design video games tailored for this population [@anguera2013].
 
 
## Racing games
 
One of the most promising game genres for cognitive research are racing video games [@belchior2019; @cherney2008; @li2016; @wu2013]. This is because they are typically less violent than first person shooter games; they are also easier to grasp by new gamers [@belchior2013] and easier to create for developers—which makes this genre ideal for cognitive training research [@anguera2013]. Most importantly, this genre of video games can be easily adapted to capture the key mechanics of first or third person shooter games, and thus may offer similar cognitive benefits than first or third person shooter games do.
 
One study for example had young adults train for 10 hours on either an FPS (i.e., *Medal of Honor*), a racing game (*Need for Speed*) or a puzzle game (*Ballance*) and evaluated the impact of playing those games on visual search performance [@wu2013]. Compared to training on the puzzle game, training on either the FPS or the racing game lead to improvements in divided attention and top-down attention control. Similarly, training on an FPS (*Unreal Tournament 2004*) or on a racing game (i.e., *Mario Kart*) may both improve visuo-motor control; although the effects might not be strictly identical [@li2016].
 
Racing games have also been used to train older adults. One study had 65-86 year olds train for a total of 60 hours on either a racing game (i.e., *Crazy Taxi*) or a brain-training software (i.e., PositScience *InSight*) while others were part of a no-training control group [@belchior2019]. The results suggest that both forms of training had modest transfer effects which for some were not present at post-test but only in the follow-up, 3 months later. Mental rotation, which was reported to improve with playing a racing game in younger adults [@cherney2008] does not seem to be affected in older adults.
 
While these studies suggest that using racing games might be viable pathway to cognitive enhancement, more data is needed to fully substantiate such a claim.
 
 
## Real-Time Strategy games
 
A video game genre that has comparatively gained a lot of attention lately is real-time strategy video games. While older generations of strategy video games, not unlike chess, were mainly focused on strategic thinking and slow paced (i.e., “turn-based”), real-time strategy games include fast-paced action game mechanics. For example, in the real-time strategy game *StarCraft*, the player typically has control over multiple units in parallel, each of which requires frequent orders (e.g., move, attack, build) delivered through precise mouse clicks. Optimal play may require over  200 of such actions per minute [@lewis2011].
 
 
Using participants’ self-reported video gaming habits data, @dale2017 formed four groups of participants and asked them to complete a large battery of cognitive tasks, including simple response time task, choice response time task, a go/no-go task, the Attentional Blink task, the Useful Field Of View, the Multiple Object Tracking and the Operation Span task. The four groups of participants (about n=14 per group) were habitual action video game players (AVGP), habitual real-time strategy players, people who rarely play video games (NVGP) and those who play more frequently but a wider range of game genres (i.e., “Tweeners”). Performance on the cognitive tasks differed between these groups. Overall, AVGP tended to perform best on these tasks and NVGP to perform worse with players in the real-time strategy and Tweeners groups performing somewhere in between these two groups. These cross-sectional results suggest that playing action video games but also real-time strategy games may improve performance on a variety of cognitive tasks.
 
To evaluate the causal effect of playing real-time strategy games on cognition, one study assigned 72 twenty year old (on average) women to play either one of two versions of *StarCraft* (a real-time strategy game) or *The Sims* (a slow pace life-simulator) for a total of 40 hours [completed on average in 43.7 days; @glass2013]. The alternative versions of *StarCraft* differed in the amount of information players had to simultaneously keep track of and switch between. Before and after playing these video games, participants underwent a battery of cognitive tasks (including for example the Stroop task, Task Switching and the Operation Span task) selected to represent a latent construct of “cognitive flexibility”. The results show that playing *StarCraft* improved cognitive flexibility more than playing *The Sims*. Additionally, the effects were strongest for the game version with higher load on cognitive flexibility.
 
Real-time strategy games have also been used for cognitive training in older adults [@basak2008]. 70 year olds were randomly assigned to either play *Rise of Nations* (a slow paced real-time strategy game) for a total of 23.5 hours (distributed over 4 to 5 weeks) or to a no-training, no-contract control group (about 20 persons  per group). Before and after the training (or non-training) all participants completed a battery of tasks covering what the authors call “executive control” (which included tasks like task-switching and the N-back) and “visuospatial skills” (e.g., mental rotation, attentional blink). The authors reported that playing *Rise of Nations* led to improved performance in the executive control but not in visuo-spatial skills [but see, @strenziok2014].
 
Studies investigating the association between real-time strategy game play and cognitive abilities in children are hard to find. One study had 3rd graders either play a fire-fighting real-time strategy game (*Fire Department 2: Fire Captain*) or read information about fire-fighting on a webpage for 40 minutes before taking a quiz about fire-fighting which included questions requiring to retrieve factual information, compare situations and solve problems [@chuang2007a; @chuang2007b]. Those who played the game performed better than the reading control group on fact retrieval and problem-solving items. However, it is rather unlikely that these effects are due to the game being a real-time strategy game (rather than say a puzzle game); instead it appears more plausible that learning about fire-fighting is more engaging and effective when that content is learned through active playing rather than by just reading.
 
 
## Tetris
 
*Tetris* is arguably one of the most used video game in psychological research. It has been used to reduce cravings for food, drugs and other [@skorka-brown2015], reduce intrusions of mental images related to traumatic events [@holmes2009] and to tone down the negative emotions associated with specific autobiographical memories [@engelhard2010]. *Tetris* has also been used within the domain of cognitive training, sometimes as the experimental game and other times as the active control game [for a review, see @sala2018].
 
When used for cognitive training, *Tetris* is thought to train visuospatial cognition and more specifically mental rotation abilities as the game heavily relies on mental rotation. One study, for example, had 8-9 year old children either play *Tetris* (the experimental group) or *Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?* (a commercial game focusing on geography with minimal load on mental rotation; the active control group) for eleven 30-minutes sessions distributed over multiple days [@delisi2002]. The results showed that playing *Tetris*, but not the control game, improved children’s 2D mental rotation abilities as measured using a paper-and-pencil mental rotation test.
 
Studies on young adults, suggest that 6 hours of training on *Tetris* (as compared to a no-contact, no-training group) may improve performance on some visuospatial tasks [@okagaki1994; see also @boot2008; @terlecki2008]. The effects however seem to be rather specific—training on a 2D *Tetris* version improved 2D mental rotation but not 3D mental rotation, while training on a 3D version of *Tetris* improved both [@moreau2013]—and several studies failed to observe improvements on 2D mental rotation after training on *Tetris* [@pilegard2018; @sims2002]. *Tetris* has also been used for cognitive training in older adults, however not to train mental rotation but rather as a control-game. Yet, one study reported that in older adults playing *Tetris* may improve selective attention to the same extent as an action game or training on the attention task itself [@belchior2013], perhaps because for this age group, *Tetris* is already challenging and action video games are too difficult.
The evidence supporting the usefulness of *Tetris* to improve cognition remains, therefore, mixed.
 
 
## Casual Mobile games
 
Casual mobile video game play is among the most common form of video gaming in the general population and it is increasingly popular among older adults [@chesham2017; @whitbourne2013]. There have been several attempts to evaluate the impact of such video games on cognition; the results however are not always consistent. Note that we restrict here our review to commercial games and do not include the larger literature on computerized experimental psychology tasks, such as those developed by PositScience, Lumosity or tested by @owen2010.
 
One study for example [@oei2013], had young adults train for a total of 20 hours over four weeks in various such games (*Hidden Expedition-Everest*, *Memory matrix 1.0*, *Bejewelled 2*, *Modern Combat: Sandstorm*, *The Sims 3*) and reported broad benefits (in various attentional and working memory tasks) only for the group playing the first-person shooter video game on mobile (i.e., *Modern Combat: Sandstorm*). Playing other, more casual video games did however improve performance on specific tasks (e.g., *Bejewelled 2* improving visual search) suggesting that casual video games might be used for targeted cognitive training interventions. However, using partly a different set of games and outcome measures, the same authors [@oei2014] reported no benefits of training for 20 hours on an FPS (*Modern Combat*), a real-time strategy (*Starfront Collision*) or a fast-paced arcade game (*Fruit Ninja*). Instead, they reported that slow-paced, physics game (*Cut the Rope*) lead to improvements in executive functions as indexed by performance in task-switching, flanker task and a go/no-go task. The authors provide various suggestions as to why their study failed to show improvements in the action-video-game trained group (e.g., differences in the experimental design). They also offer that the efficacy of the slow-paced physics game may be explained by that game involving cognitive processes that are important for executive functions (e.g., “strategizing, reframing and planning”). More research is needed to substantiate these claims. 
 
A recurrent issue in this literature is to determine *a priori* and explain why training on a given game should improve performance on a given cognitive task. An interesting approach, grounded in Thorndike and Woodworth’s principle of identical elements [@thorndike1901], consists in first evaluating the extent to which performance in various (casual) games correlate with performance on cognitive tasks, which are typically designed to isolate cognitive processes [@baniqued2013]. Correlations between the two sets of measures may be caused by them involving the same set of underlying cognitive processes. Games that correlate with working memory and reasoning tasks may then be used to train those abilities. Using this approach, @baniqued2014 had participants play various categories of casual video games for 15 hours and measured their cognitive abilities across a large battery of tasks both before and after that training. The authors note that playing video games selected to tap into working memory and reasoning did not improve performance on working memory and reasoning tasks but instead improved performance on divided attention tasks [@baniqued2014]. While this is undoubtedly an interesting and principled approach, more research is needed to solidify these results and gain insights into the differential effects of various game genres.
 
The literature reviewed above highlights the need to consider video game genres separately and argues for an empirical approach that contrasts specific commercial video game based on the mechanics it embodies rather than one that opposes any kind of video game to any kind of non-video game activity [@dale2020]. While most evidence for the efficacy of video games for cognitive training currently rests on the use of action video games, future studies might reveal that other game genres are also (maybe differently) beneficial for cognition. Such studies may help to identify which game mechanics in video games are important to cause various cognitive improvements. An alternative, yet complementary route, consists in evaluating the neural processes involved in various forms of video game play as well as the consequences of video game play on the human brain. Below we review the literature on the neuroscience of video game play.
 
 
## The Neuroscience of Video Game Play
 
Understanding what happens in the brain when people play video games, as well as the consequences that significant amounts of video game play has on brain structure and function may provide new insights to interpret the behavioral results described above. Playing video games has been associated with extensive neural alterations all over the brain, from sensorimotor regions to higher-order cortices such as prefrontal areas [@gong2015; @gong2019]. For example, faster motor response times to visual stimuli in AVGP, compared to people who don’t play video games, has been linked to increased white matter integrity in visual and motor pathways [@zhang2015], and AVGP in particular exhibited reduced brain activity during task preparation in the cuneus, middle occipital gyrus, and cerebellum which was interpreted to be indicative of increased neural efficiency [@gorbet2018].
 
In the following sections, we briefly review the literature to highlight how video games affect brain organization, and how these functional and structural changes might in turn explain the reported behavioral consequences of playing video games. Yet, as discussed in the behavioral section above and exemplified in a recent review [@palaus2017], identifying the impact of video game play, as if it were a homogenous activity, on brain functions may be misguided. Rather a more fruitful approach appears to focus on the information processing demands of the game play, and the exact processes engaged by the player. As a first step in that direction we consider below the impact of video game play on the brain systems linked to first reward system, and then spatial navigation before turning to the special case of action video games and the fronto-parietal networks of attention. Other brain systems (e.g., the motor system) may play important roles, but they will not be considered here. 
 
 
### Reward System
 
The brain’s reward system is involved in learning and motivation. All successful video games tap into this system by using complex reward schedules to engage players for long play durations. Differences in the cognitive effects of training with various genres of video games might be related to differences in how these video game genres specifically activate the reward system. Although recent efforts attempt to characterize the specific cognitive effects of action video gaming involving the reward system [for a review, see @bavelier2019], much remains to be uncovered as most research so far has focused on the relationship between video games and the reward system without differentiating what exact type of video game is being played. This being said, recent results show that the reward system may be a key player to consider when studying the effects of video games on the brain. 
 
When contrasting playing a first person tank shooter game to watching a blank screen, @koepp1998 reported an increase in dopamine release in the ventral striatum (measured indirectly using Positron Emission Tomography) that correlated with the performance in the game (as measured by the highest game level reached by the participant) demonstrating that playing some video games can indeed causally affect the reward system.
 
Other studies investigated the potential long-term effects of video game play on brain function and structure. @kuhn2011 observed that 14-year-old children who played frequently video games had a larger left striatum than same aged children who played infrequently, suggesting that prolonged video gaming may affect the structure of their reward system. Furthermore, these changes in structure were accompanied by functional changes in that the frequent video players also displayed a larger BOLD activity than infrequent video players in response to losses during a gambling task. Similar studies conducted on adults provide somewhat different results. @kuhn2014 observed that past video game experience correlated with gray matter volume in various brain areas (e.g., parahippocampal region) but not in the ventral striatum. These results may indicate that the effects of playing video games on the reward system may critically depend on the players age. 
 
The evidence presented so far in this section is correlational implying that the observed brain differences may actually not be caused by video gaming but rather preexist and partially determine video gaming habits. There are however at least two studies that used an intervention design (contrasting video game training to a passive control group) in order to probe the direction of the causality effect [@lorenz2015; @kuhn2014]. Each of these studies had adults in the training group play a 3D platformer game (*Super Mario 64*) for 30 minutes per day over a period of two months and compared their changes in brain function and structure to those of a passive control group. Both studies reported that playing video games affected the size of various brain structures but did not, contrary to what was observed in the cross-sectional study on children, observe any structural changes in the striatum. The video game training did however affect the responsiveness of the ventral striatum to rewards. @lorenz2015 had their participants complete a task while under the fMRI scanner both before and after the video game training (for the intervention group) or before and after the waiting period (for the passive control group). The results show that for the participants in the control group the reward responsiveness in the ventral striatum decreased substantially from pre to post-test sessions while for the participants in the video gaming group this was not the case: participants  trained on the 3D platformer video game exhibited similar activation levels in the ventral striatum in the pre and post-test session. The authors suggest these results may indicate a greater ability in the video game trained participants to maintain high levels of task motivation through the flexible control of the reward responsiveness of the striatum. They further hypothesize that this video-gaming induced effect on the reward system may be exploited for a broad range of uses cases. 
 
Rewards schedules are a key component of all successful video games and it is still unclear how long term exposure to video games impacts the reward system. Current evidence supports the view that video games may alter the reward systems functioning as well as its structure (although, possibly only during childhood). While the results reported in this section may apply to all types of video games, the behavioral evidence clearly shows that it is necessary to distinguish various video game genres. The reward schedules implemented in different video game genres may have drastically different effects on the reward system, and through the reward system, on learning. There are ongoing efforts to clarify the possible mechanisms relating playing specifically action video games, the reward system and broad cognitive performance improvements [@miendlarzewska2016; @howard-jones2016]. More work is needed to formalize reward mechanisms in video games and assess the impact of different types of video games on the functional and structural properties of the human reward system.
 
 
### Spatial Cognition and the Hippocampal Formation
 
Video game play often requires discovering, and thus navigating, new worlds, be they landscapes, buildings or intergalactic spaces. Such video games are likely to engage the hippocampus whose role in memory and navigation is well established [for reviews see @lisman2017; @eichenbaum2017].
 
Frequent video gaming in adolescence and adulthood has been associated with volumetric changes of gray matter in the hippocampal region and its projections. @kuhn2014 explored the correlation between gray matter volume and frequent gaming in adults, irrespective of the type of game being played. They measured gaming experience in a unit called *joystick years*, which reflects the lifetime amount of video game play, and evaluated to what extent joystick years was correlated with gray matter volume across all regions of the brain. Higher numbers of joystick years was associated with larger gray matter volume in both the occipital lobe and the hippocampal formation. Different gray matter volume in these two regions was proposed to reflect superior visuospatial expertise in video game players and to suggest that navigational exploration in early visual processing is affected by playing video games. Interestingly, recent findings also suggest a mediating role of the hippocampal formation during visual guidance [see @nau2018]. Another correlational study reported a positive correlation between the amount of time spent on video games and gray matter volume in the hippocampus, in particular the entorhinal cortex that surrounds hippocampus [@west2015]. The navigation demands of most video games is in line with such changes in entorhinal cortex as this structure acts as a gateway to the hippocampus, and has been associated with spatial navigation, memory, and the perception of time [@bird2008].
 
Changes in hippocampal volumes have been recently qualified as dependent on game genre and player strategies. @kuhn2014 measured gray matter volume of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in relation to the lifetime amount of video game playing. Their results show that while playing puzzle and platformer games was associated with increased parahippocampal volume, playing action video games was associated with a decrease in parahippocampal volume [@kuhn2014a]. @west2015 further qualified this effect as being related to particular cognitive strategies gamers might use for navigation, strategies that rely on different brain structures. One strategy that can be qualified as “spatial” involves constructing an internal cognitive map of the environment using landmarks and their relationships and then exploiting this map for navigation. The use of this strategy is thought to involve the hippocampus. An alternative, “non-spatial” strategy might instead rely on memorizing a fixed sequence of actions to be completed from a given location to reach a particular endpoint (e.g., when facing the entrance of the building, go left, then right, then left again). This second strategy therefore does not involve building internal representations but merely memorizing stimulus-response mappings. This non-spatial strategy is thought to involve the striatum. @west2015 used a task where players navigated through a maze in the presence of landmarks that could be exploited to create an internal cognitive map. They then tested the same players on the same maze but removed the landmarks. Participants using a “spatial” strategy would be unable to use their internal maps in this situation as the landmarks were necessary to ground their cognitive map. Participants using a “non-spatial” strategy, on the other hand, would not be affected by this manipulation as they could still execute the memorized sequences of actions to reach the target. @west2015 argue that the decrease in hippocampal volume observed in AVGP relative to NVGP may be accounted for AVGP relying more systematically on a non-spatial navigation strategy; in agreement with their hypothesis, AVGP performed better than NVGP when landmarks were removed, indicating that they exploited more systematically the non-spatial navigation strategy.
 
To further investigate the impact of spatial strategy during action video game play on hippocampal volume, @west2018 conducted an intervention experiment comparing three groups of participants, one that was trained for 90 hours on action video games (e.g., *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*), one that was trained for 90 hours on a 3D platformer video game (e.g., *Super Mario 64*) and a no contact group. Before and after the training entorhinal cortex, gray matter volume in the hippocampus was measured. Contrasting video game genres and play strategies shows that gray matter volume was reduced in the hippocampus after action video game training but only in participants using a non-spatial strategy. Yet, when a spatial strategy was used during training, action video game training resulted in increased hippocampal volume. Interestingly, among those trained on the 3D platformer, spatial learning was associated with increased gray matter volume in the hippocampus and non-spatial learning to increased gray matter volume in entorhinal cortex. The authors confirmed the impact these results in an additional training experiment which entailed training for 90 hours on action video games (e.g., *Call of Duty Modern: Warfare*). They note that it is only when the use of spatial strategy was encouraged during training that participants showed increased hippocampal formation volume. In conclusion, the neural impact of playing video games is mediated not only by the game genre but also by the very game play characteristics the player exhibit. This state of affair makes it clear that the impact of video game play on brain organization need to be qualified according to the processes the players engage while playing. As video games span widely different experiences, looking for the neural correlates of video game play in general is likely to remain an ill-posed research question. Finally, while the possibility to increase hippocampal volume through video games is promising to possibly address cognitive decline and in particular memory loss in aging, the directionality of the effects are yet not well understood. For example, reduction in gray matter volume was also observed after 5 days of intense mental calculation training (4 hours per day with two 10 minutes breaks), while at the same time performance being improved by the training [@takeuchi2011]. Such results indicate that reductions in gray matter volume might not always be negative and/or reflect cognitive decline. Taking everything into account, genres and strategies affect how playing video games alters anatomical structures of the brain, calling for careful consideration of the way video games are designed, what content they present, and what strategies must be used to achieve the goals of the game.
 
 
### Attentional Networks and Action Video Games
 
The strongest behavioral evidence regarding the impact of action video game training on cognition concerns increases in players’ attentional resources over space, time, and objects as well as enhanced flexibility in the allocation of attention [@bavelier2019]. In this section we present functional and structural brain modifications that may underlie such attentional improvements.
 
Attentional functions are mediated by two main neural networks [@buschkuehl2012]: a *ventral network of attention*, which encompasses the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventral frontal cortex (VFC) and has been implicated in switching attention (as when redirecting attention towards a novel element in the environment); a *dorsal network of attention*, which consists of the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and intra-parietal cortex and has been associated with strategic, goal-directed, top-down control over attention allocation. Coordination between the bottom-up and top-down networks has been associated with faster and more accurate responses to targets in a variety of cognitive tasks. Interventions targeting the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex region, at least in children, enhances executive functions performance, including attentional control [e.g., @wang2018; @siniatchkin2017]. Furthermore, these brain structures work in concert with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) which monitors and resolves conflicts, regulating in part the activity in the frontoparietal systems of attention [@petersen2012]. Action video game play has been associated with more efficient neural activities in frontoparietal regions, and enhanced structural and functional connectivities in prefrontal networks, limbic system, as well as more posterior sensorimotor networks [@gong2017]. This enhanced neural resource allocations in dorsal attentional network may contribute to the improved top-down attentional control and more efficient suppression of distracting information documented in AVGP [@bavelier2012]. Attentional control can indeed optimize the selection of sensory information by two different mechanisms: by selecting more relevant signals, or by suppressing irrelevant signals and preventing noise to be transmitted to higher-order processes. Interestingly, AVGP not only benefit from enhanced attention to targets, they also show superior ability to suppress distractors [@bavelier2012]. To track the fate of distractors during an attention-demanding visual task, several studies measured steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), an imaging technique that uses periodic stimuli to frequency-tag neural responses in the visual cortex. Using this technique, both @mishra2011 and @krishnan2013 documented active suppression of distractors in AVGP, in line with enhanced selective attention. Since the SSVEP have the same frequency as the driving stimulus, it is possible to concurrently record responses to several stimuli if they are presented at different flickering rates. @mishra2011 measured SSVEP amplitudes, which are affected by selection and filtering processes in attention, in response to peripheral and foveal stimuli in a target detection task. While the SSVEP amplitude in response to attended targets was the same in AVGP and NVGP, SSVEP amplitude to distractors was decreased in AVGP relative to NVGP, suggesting enhanced filtering of irrelevant information. Similarly, @krishnan2013 compared SSVEP responses to targets and distractors in two groups of video game players, AVGP and role-playing video game players who served as their control group. Measuring signal-to-noise ratios of evoked potentials to both targets and distractors, @krishnan2013 showed that playing first person shooters could improve both the selection of targets and the suppression of distractors.
 
How bottom-up and top-down processes may change to both improve target selection and distractor suppression was assessed in an fMRI correlational study comparing AVGP relative to NVGP. @föcker2018 recorded fMRI scans while AVGP and NVGP participated in a cross-modal, endogenous Posner-cueing task. Young adults were presented with an auditory cue indicating the most likely location of a subsequent target on which participants were to perform a difficult, near-threshold visual discrimination task. This paradigm, closely modeled after @corbetta2002, allows one to separate neural responses to the auditory cues, which direct the attention allocation for the task to come, from the neural responses during the difficult visual task itself. The frontoparietal network, which is thought to mediate attention allocation, was more activated in NVGP than in AVGP when participants processed the cue and thus prepared for the task to come. This result may suggest that attention allocation is more efficient in AVGP than in NVGP. Interestingly, a small percentage of trials were in fact catch trials where only visual noise, but no visual target, was presented. In these catch trials, participants needed to withhold their response. AVGP outperformed NVGP on such trials exhibiting less false alarms. Moreover, only for AVGP did activation in the temporoparietal junction, middle frontal gyrus, and superior parietal cortex predicted their reduced false alarm rate, suggesting that these areas may operate and interact differently in AVGP compared to NVGP. Overall, these studies suggest that AVGP may benefit from better attentional control, or more flexibility in allocating attention, perhaps through a reconfiguration of the cross-talk between the main frontoparietal areas that mediate attention.
 
Whether these superior attentional skills result from alterations of processing in the goal-oriented, top-down attentional network, or rather from better filtering of irrelevant, potentially distracting information within early sensory cortices (or both) remains an open question. Neural markers of early attentional filtering were compared in EEG-based correlational studies contrasting AVGP and NVGP. @föcker2019, for example, tested if visual event related potentials (ERP) components differed between AVGP and NVGP in a high precision visual selective attention task. Faster response times and improved perceptual performance in AVGP was observed; yet, early markers of attentional selection such as the posterior N1 and the P1 were identical across groups. Differences between AVGP and NVGP were only observed in parietal generators such as the P2 and the anterior N1 components. As the P2 has been previously linked to task demands [@finnigan2011; @lefebvre2005], these results may indicate that AVGP are able to more effectively adapt attentional resources to varying tasks demands. A similar conclusion was reached by another intervention ERP study [@wu2012] that recruited 25 adults and recorded ERPs before and after 10 hours of video game training. 
 
Participants with no video game experience in the previous 4 years, were randomly assigned to one of two training groups: the action group played *Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault* (FPS), whereas the control group played *Ballance*, a 3D puzzle game. Later, during the testing session, participants performed an attentional visual field task which assesses the ability to detect a target among distractors. As in @föcker2019, the two training groups exhibited comparable early sensory ERPs, in line with comparable comparable early attentional selection processes across training. Also, as in @föcker2019, the action trained group showed an increased P2 amplitude. Moreover, the amplitude of the P3 was also increased in the action trained group, possibly indicating enhanced attentional resources being allocated to the task [@kok2001]. Overall, these results are in line with the proposal that the differences in attentional performance between AVGP and NVPG may reflect a functional reorganization of the goal-oriented, top-down, dorsal attentional network with distractor suppression being implemented at a central level, rather than through early perceptual filtering.
 
Furthermore, playing video games, irrespective of the specific game genre, seems to affect structural and functional properties of parts of the frontal cortex. A longitudinal training experiment study for example, evaluated the structural changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) resulting from two-month of training with *Super Mario 64*, a 3D platformer, non-action video game that requires navigational skills [@kuhn2014]. The results indicate that playing this video game induced structural changes by increasing the gray matter volume in the right DLPFC. Similarly, a correlational study reported that the self-reported weekly hours adolescents spent playing video games correlates positively with the thickness of their left DLPFC and left frontal eye fields [FEFs; @kuhn2014b]—cortical thickness is similar but not identical to gray matter volume [@winkler2010].
 
It has also been reported that relative to NVGP, AVGP have enhanced intra- and inter-network connectivities in the central executive network and salient network [@gong2016]. These two networks are highlighted using fMRI measurements; the central executive network is associated with working memory, planning, and getting prepared to select an appropriate response to a stimulus, whereas the salient network with nodes in the subcortical reward system has been linked to salient stimuli detection as well as integrating emotional, sensory, and interoceptive signals [@menon2015]. The central executive network typically contains the DLPFC and is engaged during attention-demanding tasks [@fox2006]. Further analysis of large-scale networks with diffusion tensor imaging, which evaluates how strongly specific areas are connected, shows that those who spend more weekly hours playing action video games display an increased efficiency (as defined in graph theory) in local, global, and nodal levels of prefrontal, limbic, and sensorimotor networks [@gong2017]. The local, global, and nodal efficiencies, respectively, reflect an increased fault tolerance across the network, improved information flow across the whole network, and the importance of a node, respectively. These neural regions are responsible for processing visual information, spatial orientation, motion perception, selective attention, and integrating multimodal stimuli. This finding supports the view that neural efficiency increases by mediating goal-oriented, top-down attentional processes as a consequence of automating visual sensorimotor tasks and delegating them to areas that handle low-level sensory processing.
 
While our understanding of the effects of playing video games on the human brain has improved considerably over the last decade, it remains nevertheless limited. Most of the literature reviewed is correlational in nature and based exclusively on adult participants. Studying young adults cross-sectionally is a cost-effective strategy to highlight candidate structures and generate and test hypotheses. Indeed, cross-sectional studies only involve a subject selection phase (using surveys for screening) and an assessment phase, while intervention studies require *in addition* multiple training sessions and a second assessment phase (to serve as a post-intervention test to be compared to the pre-intervention test). Intervention studies furthermore involve a high management cost to assure that participants don’t drop out and complete the various steps of the study within the planned time frame. Cross-sectional studies are cost-effective to highlight interesting patterns; however, as for behavioral studies, this strategy needs to be complemented with intervention studies to establish causality and rule out the possibility that the neural differences between habitual action video gamers and non-gamers pre-dated the gaming experiences. Furthermore, the studies reviewed above were mainly conducted on young adults. However, the mechanisms involved may differ with age as the time course of brain plasticity is likely to differ across brain areas. It will thus be important to include pediatric samples in the future. 
 
## Concluding Remarks
Research on the cognitive consequences of video game play has boomed over the past 15 years. As the range of video games tested widens, it becomes apparent that not all video games have the same cognitive impact. Rather, studies systematically contrasting specific game genres indicate that the content of the video game, the user interactions it requires, and attentional processes it engages are of paramount importance. This fact has two consequences. First, it makes little sense to ask about the cognitive impact of video game play; rather, it is important to recognize the variety of experiences video game play affords. Here we have reviewed game genres that have been used over the past 15 years using a game classification that might have been relevant for the covered research but is unlikely to upstand the drastic changes in game types, gamer profiles and gaming habits that have emerged since [@dale2020; @dale2017a]; some initial work is being done to better characterize video gaming for cognitive research [@dale2020; @cardoso-leite2020]. Second, there is a need to build better theories on why playing certain video games but not others improve cognitive abilities; one route towards building such theories is to contrast commercial video games which differ by specific game mechanics or by specific content [@cardoso-leite2020]. Following this strategy, past research has focused mainly on contrasting “action video games” (i.e., mostly first and third person shooters) to other commercial video games (e.g., puzzle games). A recent meta-analysis supports a causal relationship between playing action video games and improvements in top-down attention and spatial cognition, with effects on other domains requiring further studies [@bediou2018]. This is not to say, however, that this genre of video games is the only genre of interest for cognitive training. More recently, studies have investigated the effectiveness of racing games and real time strategy games, which may be suitable for a wider audience than action video games. While promising results have been reported, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of these alternative game genres and determine the mechanisms by which they may enhance cognition. The strategy of contrasting multiple game genres within the same study may be useful to both evaluate the relative efficacy of different game genres and to unveil the relevant game mechanics.
 
 
The study of how video games in general, and action video games in particular, engage and affect the brain has revealed network wide changes in reward, memory and attention brain circuits. This variety of effects suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible for the observed cognitive benefits is likely to go beyond the training of a few specific cognitive processes [@bavelier2012]. Rather, aligned changes in memory, reward processing and mood, as well as attentional networks efficiency may result in faster processing speed, facilitating in turn a variety of cognitive processes. Future work is needed to unravel the link between the behavioral improvements noted after action video game play and their neural bases.
Overall, while significant progress has been made over the past 15 years on our understanding of how to leverage video games for cognitive enhancement, there remain many unknowns in this young emerging field. First, the work so far makes it clear that different genres of video games have different effects on cognition, differences in game mechanics have been hypothesized but they remain to be fully tested to firmly document why playing action video games but not social simulation games may improve cognition, for example. Unpacking key game mechanics is central if we are to leverage lessons from action video game research to design therapeutic or educational video games. Second, although a theoretical framework around brain plasticity, attention and learning for the documented effects has been proposed, many of the mechanistic details remain to be worked out [@bavelier2019; @bavelier2012]. Third, our work has focused so far chiefly on cognition; understanding how to best induce plastic changes in other domains, such as emotion or social behavior, is equally important. Finally, most of the literature so far has focused on adults. As we now better understand the game mechanics that promote brain plasticity, the time has come to ask how to best use video games to foster children's development.

 
## Future perspectives
 
Research over the past 15 years has focused mainly on establishing and validating the impact of action video games and probing the breadth of their impact on various cognitive constructs (e.g., top-down attention vs. bottom-up attention). Much remains to be done to catalogue and fully describe the impact of different video game genres on various aspects of behavior. Furthermore, our understanding of the taxonomy of video games needs to be improved so that we can move from vague high-level labels (e.g., “action video games”) to objective, measurable indices (e.g. type of attention required; exact reward schedule implemented etc). In the future, we should be able to make quantitative predictions as to which video game to train on in order to enhance performance in one cognitive construct versus another. The challenges that lie ahead of us will require methodological and theoretical innovations as well as multi-lab and interdisciplinary team work.
